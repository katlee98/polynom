Title: Apply a Special Polynomial Function to a Vector
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Katrina",
           family = "Poppe",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "poppek@student.ubc.ca"
           )
Description: The polynom package currently contains the 'poly_fcn()' function that applies a custom polynomial equation to a vector of numeric values.
    The 'poly_fcn()' does not have much real-world value but let's just pretend that it is a commonly used calculation in soil science.
